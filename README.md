# vector
simple vector implementation  in C++ for practice

This code is for demonstration and educational purposes
it is built and tested on linux ubuntu, g++ compiler, and c++17 standard
currently the asd::vector class has the following functionality:
  - asd::vector<T>::vector(): no argument constructor
  - copy constructor
  - move constructor
  - copy assignment operator
  - move assignment operator
  - destructor
  - push_back
  - emplace_back
  - [] operator
  - [] const operator

you can find asd::vector is implemented in src/vector.hpp
for usage example you can check example.cpp
